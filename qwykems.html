    <h1>Welcome to QwyckEm's</h1>
    <p>During the college football season my friends, Alee, Raleigh and myself were part of different College Football Pick Em's groups. Traditionally, each group commissioner would manually create Pick Em's lists, collect participants' predictions, and input game results into an Excel spreadsheet to determine the best predictor.</p>
    <p>Realizing that this tedious process took hours away from socializing and fun, we created QwyckEm's! Our platform streamlines the entire process by automatically generating Pick Em's sheets using smart algorithms. It records participants' selections, tracks game results, and ranks players effortlessly.</p>
    <p>Instead of spending over three hours per week manually updating spreadsheets for 18 weeks and bowl games, QwyckEm's turns the game into a fun, instant activity for groupsâ€”saving time and enhancing the experience!</p>
